This repo contains the data on theoretical peak performance of NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs since about 2001 as well as IDL and Python code to plot the trends.

Code requires IDL and [mglib] library or Python and pylab for plotting. To make the plot, simply do:

    IDL> mg_cpu_vs_gpu

or

	python cpu_vs_gpu_plot.py
